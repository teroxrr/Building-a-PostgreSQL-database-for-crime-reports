# Building a PostgreSQL database for crime reports

This is a simple example of how to create a database using PostgreSQL.

Besides the database itself we will also go through the process of adding a scheme and a table.

In addition, groups and users will be created with different access privileges depending on their functions.

This diagram illustrates a high level overview of our goal:
